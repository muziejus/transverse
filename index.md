Note: First, I want to thank everyone for coming to this conference. It’s been
a great weekend. I also want to thank the organizers of the conference,
especially Julian, who helped me out a bunch in the homestretch.

This is kind of a weird talk for me, since it’s all new material. These ideas
had been kicking around in my head for about half a year, but upon being invited to the
conference and then reading the description, the ideas sort of took enough
form where I could start putting them down on paper, or, at least, whatever
this is. So I appreciate your patience and look forward to your thoughts at
the end. Furthermore, my email address is here, too, as is my twitter name, in
case you don’t get a chance to talk to me or you only think of something
later.

![Albertinum in 1850](/images/albertinum-crop.png)

<div class="credit">Ludwig Clericus, “[Collegium
Albertinum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg#/media/File:Albertinum.JPG),”
c. 1850.</div> 

Note: But first, let’s put some balls of conflict into motion. I want to start
with a story that may be familiar to you all. Hopefully, it isn’t, but we’ll
see. This is a drawing of the Collegium Albertinum, the oldest building in the
University of Königsberg, from the 19th century. It doesn’t exist anymore,
having been bombed to dust by the RAF, but here it looks similar to how it did
in the early 18th century. I ask you, then, please to imagine yourself as a
student back then, a generation or so older than Immanuel Kant, whose tomb
today stands not far from the collegium, behind the cathedral on Kneiphof.

<div class="credit">Johann Georg Puschner, “[Der sauffende
Student](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Georg_Puschner#/media/File:Der_sauffende_Student.jpg),”
1725.</div>

Note: Let’s say it’s one in the morning, and you’ve been drinking with your classmates. Invariably, so the story goes,
the challenge will arise: can you cross all seven bridges across the Pregel
River once and only once? Maybe you make a wager with your classmates and
stumble out into the bracing Baltic wind, convinced that, this time, it’s
surely possible, and the walking begins, perhaps with the nearest bridge, now
known as the medOvij most, or honey bridge. None of us was alive back in the
early 1700s,

Note: so let’s get a sense of what Königsberg looked like back then. Here I’ve
colored in the Pregel to make the bridges stand out a bit more, and this is
where the Collegium was, behind the cathedral on Kneiphof.

---

![Trying to walk the bridges in Königsberg](/images/pregel-walks.gif)

Note: Furthermore, because we’re not in Königsberg, and most of the applicable
bridges have been destroyed anyway, we can’t actually get drunk and totter
from bridge to bridge. I’ve sort of made an approximation of what could follow
here, but the key is that performing the challenge you’re negotiating with your
classmates can take several forms.

---

1. Cross the bridge by the Cathedral,
2. then take the Holzbrücke towards the castle,
3. then Schmiedebrücke by the castle back onto Kneiphof,
4. then cross back at Krämerbrücke and… rats ok let’s start again…

Note: You can list the steps out, for example, turning the journey into
something resembling driving directions or what a GPS device would tell you.

![A failed path in Königsberg](/images/konigsberg-1613-pregel-crop-path.jpg)

Note: The directions above can also take the form of a sketched out path on a
map. Yet the change of style carries with it a subtle epistemic shift. What on the previous slide could
be considered as a kind of transversing of space, here, instead, is now a
transversed space. There is no change in this map; the path is frozen. In
fact, this map describes at least two sets of walking directions, the to and fro.
The motion, the process, both of these are gone. This map has
ripped the narrative energy out of your nighttime prowl, turning an event into
a datum, events into data. Two similar examples:

---

> Suddenly she took the Catholic vow. She came into the church silently… Many
churches saw her: _St. Julien le Pauvre_, the church of _St. Germain des Prés_,
_Ste. Clothilde_. Even on the cold tiles of the Russian church, in which there
is no pew, she knelt alone, lost and conspicuous, her broad shoulders above
her neighbours, her feet large and as earthly as the feet of a monk.
She strayed into the _rue Picpus_, into the gardens of the convent of
_L’Adoration Perpétuelle_. 

<div class="credit">Barnes, _Nightwood_, 49–50. Italics in original.</div>

Note: Robin Vote has taken to wandering away from her husband, and here we see
her moving through various churches in Paris. Barnes doesn’t give us an
itinerary per se, but compare this description here to its rendering as data.

---

<div class="map" id="robin-vote"></div>

Note: Robin’s straying is frozen and removed from the clustering Barnes
provides narratively “many churches saw her” creates one group and then
“strayed into the rue Picpus” a second, with an indistinct "Russian church in
which there is no pew" between them. Instead, here the clustering is
geographical: rive gauche churches in contrast to the rive droite convent. And
now I'm forced to decide that "Russian church" refers to the Nevsky Cathedral
in Paris, breaking the promise of uncertainty that Barnes provided. Yet we’re
still building here with these nighttime strayings… Königsberg, Paris,

> The carrier led her across Market then over toward City Hall. In a street
close enough to the drab, stone openness of the Civic Center to be infected by
its gray, he rendezvoused with another carrier, and they exchanged sacks.
Oedipa decided to stick with the one she’d been following. She tailed him all
the way back down the littered, shifty, loud length of Market and over on
First Street to the trans-bay bus terminal, where he bought a ticket for
Oakland. So did Oedipa.

> They rode over the bridge and into the great, empty glare of the Oakland
afternoon. The landscape lost all variety.

<div class="credit">Pynchon, _The Crying of Lot 49_, 130.</div>

Note: Here, it’s no longer late at night, but rather early morning.
Nevertheless, Oedipa Maas is also wandering, partly, in search of the elusive
sign of the horn. But she’s also partly fleeing, and even once she catches a
strong lead, she ends up in Oakland, not recognizing her surroundings until
finally noticing that 24 hours have elapsed and she’s literally where she
began, in front of John Nefastis’s house.

---

<div class="map" id="oedipa-maas"></div>

Note: A map draws the strong straight line from the center of San Francisco to
Oakland, but we can hardly even call this a “representation” of the quoted
paragraph, and especially not of the beginning of the second, where the
landscape loses all variety and Oedipa also ends up lost.

Note: There’s a lot going on in these three examples, and the latter two I’ll
save for a more detailed examination that makes up the bulk of this talk. But
first, I want to finish up with our Königsberg dilemma, aiming to show what
the drunken set of challenges demonstrates about how we think of space.

![Euler’s map of Königsberg](https://i.imgur.com/HTezdGR.png)

<div class="credit">Euler, “[Solutio Problematis Ad Geometriam Situs
Pertinentis](http://eulerarchive.maa.org/docs/originals/E053.pdf).”</div>

Note: So, in 1735, Leonhard Euler presents a paper before the St. Petersburg
Academy of Sciences. When published, the article includes this abstracted map of
Königsberg, a step removed from any sort of map one would use to move around
in the city, which I’ve adapted here. Kneiphof becomes just “A,” and each
bridge is a lowercase letter. Euler is trying to prove that it’s impossible to
cross all seven bridges once and only once

---

> Si fuerint plures duabus regiones, ad quas ducentium pontium numerus est
impar, tum certo affirmari potest, talem transitum non dari.

> _If there are more than two areas to which an odd number of bridges lead,
then such a journey is impossible._

<div class="credit">Euler,
“[Solutio…](http://eulerarchive.maa.org/docs/originals/E053.pdf)” and “[The
Solution of a Problem Relating to the Geometry of
Position](https://books.google.com/books?id=XqYTk0sXmpoC&lpg=PA2&pg=PA8#v=onepage&q&f=false)”
in Biggs, Lloyd, Wilson, _Graph Theory 1736–1936_.</div>

Note: Even for someone not particularly mathematically inclined like me,
Euler’s proof is exceptionally readable, and it leads to the conclusion I’ve
excerpted here. Nevertheless, what I want to underscore is the way the
story moves from our imagined fiction of drunk students stumbling around the
city to Euler’s sterilizing reframing of the question. People are removed from
the question, and places become mere letters. From GPS directions to the
somehow less precise pink path, to Euler’s abstracted map, then

---

![Königsberg as graph](/images/euler-graph.png)

Note: to this. Current accounts of the bridges problem abstract it even
further. At least Euler still speaks of “regiones” and “pontes,” regions and
bridges. Here, the bridges are now “edges” and the shores of the Pregel bound
“nodes.” Narrative to map to graph, the locus of interest for the branch of
mathematics, graph theory, that emerged out of Euler’s paper. The
people, the buildings… none of that matters anymore

It’s tempting to read this as a progression from the particular to the
universal, as surely that was Euler’s goal, to divine the universal rule that
solves the bridges problem for any situation.

---

![Albany](/images/albany.png)

Note: Using Euler’s proof, from what I can tell, Albany fails the test, but
that’s only since Albany isn’t separated by bridges.

---

![New York bridges graph](/images/nyc-bridges.png)

Note: New York City gets complicated and depends on how you count bridges. If
you take only the bridges that connect one borough to another, it seems like
the answer is no. Only Manhattan has an even number of bridges. Adding tunnels
makes it possible, because Manhattan stays even, but now Queens and Brooklyn
are also even. But even here, I’m cheating a bit because you have to be able
to cross from Manhattan into Randalls Island three times. Like I said, it’s
complicated.

---

![Königsberg as graph](/images/euler-graph.png)

Note: But the shift towards finding the universal solution has its own
particularity. As I mentioned, the people, the buildings–all of that fades
away because now the central issue is, always already, the question of the
bridges. The universal rule regarding what is or is not an “Eulerian path” is
so specific as to be nearly useless.

> Beneath the haze stirred up by the winds, the urban island… sinks down at
Greenwich, then rises again to the crests of Midtown, quietly passes over
Central Park and finally undulates off into the distance beyond Harlem. A wave
of verticals. Its agitation is momentarily arrested by vision. The gigantic
mass is immobilized before the eyes.</blockquote>

<div class="credit">De Certeau, _The Practice of Everyday Life_, 91.</div>

Note: This is kind of startling, because we’re trained to think of maps as
telling the whole story. They enact what Michel de Certeau describes as the
view from the top of the World Trade Center, the God’s Eye view of the world,
arrested and made legible to the objective observer. Or, as Donna Haraway
describes it, our lust to be a viewpoint and nothing more leaps “out of the
marked body and into a conquering gaze,” attempting the “god-trick of seeing
everything from nowhere.” We are in the territory of Martin Jay’s scopic
regime of modernity and of Timothy Mitchell’s world-as-exhibition, a world
that is “ordered and organised, calculated and rendered unambiguous.”

---

![Eulerian map of New York City](/images/nyc-euler-map.png)

Note: But for all that lack of ambiguity arising from soaring to a height of
unmediated observation, in that conquering gaze of the voyeur--and the term is
de Certeau’s--this map would certainly not have helped me get on the train
yesterday to come to Albany.

Turning the text, the story, the narrative into data and plotting it on a map
does tremendous damage to something, it seems, but it’s not entirely clear how
to describe what that something is.

---

> The ordinary practitioners of the city live “down below,” below the
thresholds at which visibility begins. They walk—an elementary form of this
experience of the city; they are walkers, _Wandersmänner_, whose bodies follow
the thicks and thins of an urban “text” they write without being able to read
it.

<div class="credit">De Certeau, _The Practice of Everyday Life_, 93.</div>

Note: De Certeau describes walkers as a contrast to the voyeurs floating
above. Where the voyeurs arrest process in pursuing the fiction of total
knowledge, the walkers are always generating new knowledge as they traverse
the city. The damage done by the en-dataing and mapping, then, is the erasure
of the writing of the city made by these walkers.

Note: Hence starting this talk with asking you to imagine yourselves as
drunk German students in Königsberg, which is to say, as walkers. Not as
voyeurs with a map of the city before you. Instead, as students, you relied on
the maps in your head, what Kevin Lynch calls mental maps, that provide the
image of the city. That’s how, sitting in a Hospitium and drinking the night
away, you know ahead of time that your proposed path won’t work. On crossing
the Krämerbrücke back towards the castle, you realize there’s no way to get
back to Kneiphof to cross the remaining three bridges. 

In the case of Oedipa and Robin, they move outside of their mental maps,
having wandered into a state of being lost, both literally and metaphorically.
Further, as they move into areas less sketched in in their mental maps, the
distinctions become fainter—a Russian church, not the Nevsky Cathedral. Or, as
in Oakland, the landscape becomes indistinct, lacking mental touchpoints that
can bring the picture into focus.

<div class="credit">Lynch, _The Image of the City_, 19.</div>

Note: Lynch’s research on these mental maps or mental images breaks apart the
city into parts. Confusingly using some of the same terminology as graph
theory, namely nodes, edges, and paths, for Lynch edges are impermeable
boundaries, while nodes are spaces of transition, perhaps from one path to
another or one district to another.
