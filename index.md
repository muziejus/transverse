Note: First, I want to thank everyone for coming to this conference. It’s been
a great weekend. I also want to thank the organizers of the conference,
especially Julian, who helped me out a bunch in the homestretch.

This is kind of a weird talk for me, since it’s all new material. These ideas
had been kicking around in my head for about half a year, but upon being
invited to the conference and then reading the description, the ideas sort of
took enough form where I could start putting them down on paper, or, at least,
whatever this is. So though I aim to talk about wandering without a map, I do
have a map for what I’ll be talking about. Either way, I appreciate your
patience and look forward to your thoughts at the end. Furthermore, my email
address is here, too, as is my twitter name, in case you don’t get a chance to
talk to me or you only think of something later.

![Albertinum in 1850](/images/albertinum-crop.png)

--> Ludwig Clericus, “[Collegium
Albertinum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg#/media/File:Albertinum.JPG),”
c. 1850. 

Note: But first, let’s put some balls of conflict into motion. The first
gambit might be familiar, but even so, I hope to tell it in a new way.  This
is a 19th century drawing of the Collegium Albertinum, the oldest building in
the University of Königsberg. It doesn’t exist anymore, having been bombed to
dust by the RAF, but here it looks similar to how it did in the early 18th
century. I ask you, then, please to imagine yourself as a student back then, a
generation or so older than Immanuel Kant, whose tomb today stands not far
from the collegium, behind the cathedral on Kneiphof, KalininGRAT’s central
island.

![Der sauffende Student](/images/sauffende-student-crop.png)

--> Johann Georg Puschner, “[Der sauffende
Student](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Georg_Puschner#/media/File:Der_sauffende_Student.jpg),”
1725.

Note: Let’s say it’s one in the morning, and you’ve been drinking with your
classmates. Here’s a contemporary image of what that might’ve looked like.
Invariably, so the story goes, the challenge will arise: can you cross all
seven bridges across the Pregel River once and only once? Maybe you make a
wager with your classmates that it surely is, and you think you have the
answer. Stepping into the bracing Baltic winds, the walking begins, perhaps
with the nearest bridge, now known as the medOvij most, or honey bridge. None
of us was alive back in the early 1700s,

--> “[Gedenkblatt zur sechshundertjährigen Jubelfeier der

Stich von Joachim Bering von

Note: so let’s get a sense of the nature of the challenge. Here I’ve colored
in the Pregel to make the seven bridges stand out a bit more, and this is
where the Collegium was, behind the cathedral on Kneiphof.

---

![Trying to walk the bridges in Königsberg](/images/pregel-walks.gif)

Note: Furthermore, because we’re not in Königsberg, and most of the applicable
bridges have been destroyed anyway, we can’t actually get drunk and totter
from bridge to bridge. I’ve sort of made an approximation of what could follow
here, but performing the challenge you’re negotiating with your
classmates can take several forms. I suggested stumbling out and walking late
at night to alliterate bracing and Baltic.

---

1. Cross the bridge by the Cathedral,
2. then take the Holzbrücke towards the castle,
3. then Schmiedebrücke by the castle back onto Kneiphof,
4. then cross back at Krämerbrücke and… rats ok let’s start again…

Note: But you can list the steps out, for example, turning the journey into
something resembling directions or what, these days, a GPS device
would tell you.

---

![A failed path in Königsberg](/images/konigsberg-1613-pregel-crop-path.jpg)

Note: The attempt at a solution can also take the form of a sketched out path on a
map, which itself can be sketched on a tabletop or napkin. The directions in
the previous slide would look like this. Each way of tackling the challenge
involves a subtle shift. What on the previous slide
could be considered as a kind of traversing of space, here, instead, is now
a traversed space. There is no change in this map; the path is frozen. In
fact, this map describes at least two sets of walking directions, the to and
fro. The motion, the process, both of these are gone. This map has ripped the
narrative energy out of your nighttime prowl, turning an event into a datum,
events into data. Two similar examples:

---

> Suddenly she took the Catholic vow. She came into the church silently… Many
churches saw her: _St. Julien le Pauvre_, the church of _St. Germain des
Prés_, _Ste. Clothilde_. Even on the cold tiles of the Russian church, in
which there is no pew, she knelt alone, lost and conspicuous… She strayed into
the _rue Picpus_, into the gardens of the convent of _L’Adoration Perpétuelle_… and looked down at the tomb of Lafayette. 

--> Barnes, _Nightwood_, 49–50. Italics in original.

Note: Robin Vote has taken to wandering away from her husband, and here we see
her moving through various churches in Paris. Djuna Barnes doesn’t give us an
itinerary per se, but compare this passage to its rendering as data.

---

![Robin’s wandering in Paris](/images/paris-1911/robin-wander.png)

--> [Basemap
engraving](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Britannica_Paris.png) by Emery Walker sc, from _Encyclopædia
Britannica Eleventh Edition_, 1911.

Note: Robin’s straying is frozen. Barnes clusters the locations narratively.
“Many churches saw her” creates one group and then “strayed into the rue
Picpus” a second, with an indistinct "Russian church in which there is no pew"
between them. Here, instead, the clustering is geographical: rive gauche
churches in contrast to the rive droite convent. And now I'm forced to decide
that "Russian church" refers specifically to the Nevsky Cathedral in Paris,
breaking the promise of uncertainty that Barnes provided with the narration.
Yet we’re still building here with these nighttime strayings… Königsberg,
Paris,

---

> The carrier led her across Market then over toward City Hall. In a street
close enough to the drab, stone openness of the Civic Center to be infected by
its gray, he rendezvoused with another carrier, and they exchanged sacks.
Oedipa decided to stick with the one she’d been following. She tailed him all
the way back down the littered, shifty, loud length of Market and over on
First Street to the trans-bay bus terminal, where he bought a ticket for
Oakland. So did Oedipa.

> They rode over the bridge and into the great, empty glare of the Oakland
afternoon. The landscape lost all variety.

--> Pynchon, _The Crying of Lot 49_, 130.

Note: Here, it’s no longer late at night, but rather morning.
Nevertheless, Oedipa Maas is also wandering, partly, in search of the elusive
sign of the horn. But she’s also partly fleeing, and even once she catches a
strong lead, she ends up in Oakland, not recognizing her surroundings until
finally noticing that 24 hours have elapsed and she’s literally where she
began, in front of John Nefastis’s house.

Note: A map draws the strong straight line from the center of San Francisco to
Oakland, but we can hardly even call this a “representation” of the quoted
paragraph, and especially not of the beginning of the second, where the
landscape loses all variety and Oedipa also ends up lost.

Note: There’s a lot going on in these three examples, and the latter two I’ll
save for a more detailed examination that makes up the bulk of this talk. But
first, I want to finish up with our Königsberg dilemma, aiming to show what
the drunken set of challenges demonstrates about space.

![Euler’s map of Königsberg](https://i.imgur.com/HTezdGR.png)

--> Euler, “[Solutio Problematis Ad Geometriam Situs
Pertinentis](http://eulerarchive.maa.org/docs/originals/E053.pdf).”

Note: In 1735, Leonhard Euler presents a paper before the St. Petersburg
Academy of Sciences. When published, the article includes a map of
Königsberg, a step removed from any sort of map one would use to move around
in the city, which I’ve adapted here. Kneiphof becomes just “A,” and each
bridge is a lowercase letter. Euler is trying to prove that it’s impossible to
cross all seven bridges once and only once

---

> Si fuerint plures duabus regiones, ad quas ducentium pontium numerus est
impar, tum certo affirmari potest, talem transitum non dari.

> _If there are more than two areas to which an odd number of bridges lead,
then such a journey is impossible._

--> Euler,
“[Solutio…](http://eulerarchive.maa.org/docs/originals/E053.pdf)” and “[The
Solution of a Problem Relating to the Geometry of
Position](https://books.google.com/books?id=XqYTk0sXmpoC&lpg=PA2&pg=PA8#v=onepage&q&f=false)”
in Biggs, Lloyd, Wilson, _Graph Theory 1736–1936_.

Note: Even for someone not particularly mathematically inclined like me,
Euler’s proof is exceptionally readable, and it leads to the conclusion I’ve
excerpted here. Nevertheless, the story has moved from our imagined fiction of
drunk students stumbling around the city or enumerating directions to Euler’s
sterilizing reframing of the question. People are removed from the question,
and places become mere letters. From GPS directions to the somehow less
precise pink path, to Euler’s abstracted map, then

---

![Königsberg as graph](/images/euler-graph.png)

Note: to this. Current accounts of the bridges problem abstract it even
further. At least Euler still speaks of “regiones” and “pontes,” regions and
bridges. Here, the bridges are now “edges” and the shores of the Pregel circle
around “vertices.” Narrative to map to this, a graph, the locus of interest for
the branch of mathematics, graph theory, that emerged out of Euler’s paper.

It’s tempting to read this as a progression from the particular to the
universal. Euler, after all, is explicitly trying to divine the universal rule
that solves the bridges problem for any situation.

--> Basemap by [Carto](http://carto.com/). Data by
[OpenStreetMap](http://openstreetmap.org), under [CC BY
SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/).

Note: Although using Euler’s proof, from what I can tell, Albany fails the test, but
that’s only since Albany isn’t separated by bridges.

---

![New York bridges graph](/images/nyc-bridges.png)

Note: New York City gets complicated and depends on how you count bridges. If
you take only the bridges that connect one borough to another, it seems like
the answer is no. Only Queens has an even number of bridges. 

---

![Königsberg as graph](/images/euler-graph.png)

Note: But the shift towards finding the universal solution has its own
particularity. As I mentioned, the people, the buildings–all of that fades
away because now the central issue is, always already, the question of the
bridges. The universal rule regarding what is or is not an “Eulerian path” is
so specific as to be nearly useless. A map of Königsberg could have several
uses. A graph, fewer.

---

![StoryMaps homepage](/images/storymaps.png)

--> Esri, [http://storymaps.arcgis.com](http://storymaps.arcgis.com)

Note: This is kind of startling, because we’re trained to think of maps as
not just telling *a* story, but of telling the whole story. As Donna Haraway
explains, “Cartography is perhaps the chief tool-metaphor of technoscience,”
as maps let the viewer 

as Donna Haraway
describes it, our lust to be a viewpoint and nothing more leaps “out of the
marked body and into a conquering gaze,” attempting the “god-trick of seeing
everything from nowhere.” We are in the territory of Martin Jay’s scopic
regime of modernity and of Timothy Mitchell’s world-as-exhibition, a world
that is “ordered and organised, calculated and rendered unambiguous.”

---

![Eulerian map of New York City](/images/nyc-euler-map.png)

Note: But for all that lack of ambiguity arising from soaring to a height of
unmediated observation, in that conquering gaze of the voyeur--and the term is
de Certeau’s--this map would certainly not have helped me get on the train
yesterday to come to Albany.

Turning the text, the story, the narrative into data and plotting it on a map
does tremendous damage to something, it seems, but it’s not entirely clear how
to describe what that something is.

---

> The ordinary practitioners of the city live “down below,” below the
thresholds at which visibility begins. They walk—an elementary form of this
experience of the city; they are walkers, _Wandersmänner_, whose bodies follow
the thicks and thins of an urban “text” they write without being able to read
it.

--> De Certeau, _The Practice of Everyday Life_, 93.

Note: De Certeau describes walkers as a contrast to the voyeurs floating
above. Where the voyeurs arrest process in pursuing the fiction of total
knowledge, the walkers are always generating new knowledge as they traverse
the city. The damage done by the en-dataing and mapping, then, is the erasure
of the writing of the city made by these walkers.

Note: Hence starting this talk with asking you to imagine yourselves as
drunk German students in Königsberg. As students, you relied on
the maps in your head, what Kevin Lynch calls mental maps, that provide the
image of the city. That’s how, sitting in a Hospitium and drinking the night
away, you know ahead of time that your proposed path won’t work. On crossing
the Krämerbrücke back towards the castle, you realize there’s no way to get
back to Kneiphof to cross the remaining three bridges. 

In the case of Oedipa and Robin, they move outside of their mental maps,
having wandered into a state of being lost, both literally and metaphorically.
Further, as they move into areas less sketched in in their mental maps, the
distinctions become fainter—a Russian church, not the Nevsky Cathedral. Or, as
in Oakland, the landscape becomes indistinct, lacking mental touchpoints that
can bring the picture into focus.

---

### _The Image of the City_

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Paths</li>
<li class="fragment">Edges</li>
<li class="fragment">Nodes</li>
<li class="fragment">Districts</li>
<li class="fragment">Landmarks</li>
</ul>

Note: The mental maps Lynch describes in the image of the city have five
components. Paths are what earlier, in a graph, we referred to as edges. Paths
are channels of movement that are predominant in the images. Not to be
confused with the edges on a graph, Lynch’s edges are *breaks* in continuity.
They are barriers, seams, and organizing features.
Nodes are similar
to the vertices in the graph, in that they are strategic, enterable points that
are junctions between paths, often including moments of shift. Districts are
homogeneous, enterable areas that are always distinguishable from inside.
Landmarks, on the other hand, are unenterable points of reference.

---

![Lynch mental map of Boston](/images/boston-cognitive-map-solar.png)

--> Lynch, _The Image of the City_, 19.

Note: In this map of Boston, we can see all five components at work in how
Lynch’s respondents conceive of the city in their minds. Most important for
the rest of this talk will be the edges. Here we can see that the Charles
River and the harbor create barriers that close in the sense of the extent of
Boston, but the central artery, now buried underground because of the Big Dig,
serves as another edge tearing through the middle of the city.

---

> The disruptive power of the edge must be reckoned with. The isolation of
the North End in Boston by the Central Artery was glaring, in the eyes of
residents and non-residents alike.

--> Lynch, _The Image of the City_, 64.

Note: Space is not, importantly, just smooth space open for movement. It’s not
paths everywhere linking nodes together. Disruptions, barriers, and other
obstacles not only prevent movement but even force the formation of new paths
to go around them. These obstructions are what I call

---

## Rocks

Note: rocks.

---

<blockquote>vast overhanging rocks, which Amphitrite<br />
batters aggressively with mighty waves.<br />
The blessed gods call these the Wandering Rocks.<br />
No birds can fly through safe, not even doves,<br />
who bring ambrosia to Zeus. One dove<br />
is always lost in that sheer gulf of stone<br />
and Zeus must send another to restore<br />
the number of the flock. No human ship<br />
has ever passed there. When one tries to enter,<br />
the waves and raging gusts of fire engulf<br />
ship timbers and the bodies of the men.<br />
</blockquote>

--> Homer, _The Odyssey_, trans. Wilson, 12.59–69.

Note: It’s a goofy name, I know, but I was thinking about how obstacles can
move, like blockers on a football field. They wander alongside the wanderer,
and, as wandering rocks, they are threats to whatever is trying to move past
them, be they doves, ships, or Robin Vote or Oedipa Maas. So what are the
rocks Robin faces? And how can we try to imagine the heterogeneous space in
which she moves and in which her own movement is hindered.

---

![Plumb’s map of Paris](/images/plumb-paris.png)

 <!-- Paris, in Barnes, _Nightwood_, ed. Plumb, 216–217. -->

Note: _Nightwood_ takes place mostly in Paris, and this is the map that
accompanies the expanded critical edition by Cheryl J. Plumb. Plumb’s map is,
to me, profoundly unsatisfying. In focusing only on the Sixth Arrondissement,
the map inflicts its own edges on the stories it can tell about Nightwood.

---

![Robin’s wandering in Paris](/images/paris-1911/robin-wander.png)

Note: If we recall, even from the short passage of Robin Vote’s wandering,
more than just the sixth arrondissement is in play, as we see here how the
narrator maps Robin’s trip to both sides of the Seine. And in fact, if we
return to the actual passage…

---

> Suddenly she took the Catholic vow. She came into the church silently… Many
churches saw her: _St. Julien le Pauvre_, the church of _St. Germain des Prés_,
_Ste. Clothilde_. Even on the cold tiles of the Russian church, in which there
is no pew, she knelt alone, lost and conspicuous…
She strayed into the _rue Picpus_, into the gardens of the convent of
_L’Adoration Perpétuelle_… and looked down at the tomb of Lafayette. 

--> Barnes, _Nightwood_, 49–50. Italics in original.

Note: we can even infer a narrative path here. Is the narrator providing us
with a list of places that Robin visited or the trajectory of her journey?
Does she, then, end up at the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts
of Jesus and Mary, over in the 12th Arrondissement, where, in Picpus
Cemetery, Lafayette is buried? Studying the novel geocritically, Amy Wells
argues that this is very much a destination for Robin, suggesting an almost
unconscious attraction to one of the hidden pockets of Americanized Paris, as
Lafayette’s tomb features an American flag, dirt from Bunker Hill, and various
commemorations and plaques from the US.

---

![Robin’s wandering in Paris](/images/paris-1911/robin-wander-path.png)

Note: So unlike the step-by-step directions of trying and failing to walk the
Königsberg bridges, instead here the narrator gestures at a course of
movement. Small wonder that Robin, while avoiding her husband, ends up in this
distant American end of Paris, reflecting her upcoming disappearance to
America with Nora Flood. Here, let’s get the audience up to speed about
Nightwood, however.

---

## _Nightwood_
### Djuna Barnes, 1936

<ul>
<li class="fragment"><span style="color: #6c71c4;">**Robin Vote**</span></li>
<li class="fragment"><span style="color: #cb4b16;">**Felix Volkbein**</span></li>
<li class="fragment"><span style="color: #859900;">**Nora Flood**</span></li>
<li class="fragment"><span style="color: #2aa198;">**Jenny Petherbridge**</span></li>
<li class="fragment"><span style="color: #b58900;">**Matthew O’Connor**</span></li>
</ul>

Note: Published in 1936, Nightwood, by Djuna Barnes, is a short novel that
concerns itself with five people who spend most of the novel in Paris. Robin Vote is a
young American who takes to wandering and drinking at night. She marries and
has a child with Felix Volkbein, a fake aristocrat searching for real
aristocracy. She leaves Felix for Robin Flood, another American, before
leaving Robin for Jenny Petherbridge, a much older, four-times divorced woman
of means. Commenting on all of this is the bawdy and complex Irish-American
doctor from San Francisco, Matthew O’Connor. The novel ends back in the US,
with Robin and Nora and Nora’s dog somehow, ambiguously reunited in some way.

---

![Robin’s wandering in Paris](/images/paris-1911/robin-wander-path.png)

Note: Back to Robin, then. This trip of hers, in fact, is unique in the novel
in that it’s the only time in the novel that the narrator inhabits Robin’s
thoughts or describes her actions from her point of view. Typically, Robin is
only reported on, by either Felix, Nora, or Jenny to Dr. O’Connor. As a crude
point of comparison, of the 260 words or so of dialog Robin has, over half
two-thirds of that speech is reported via another character in the novel.
Despite the seeming freedom of her wandering, then, the narrator tells us very
little about it, giving this example within Paris, and another about how she
would wander even beyond the city. As the narrator tells us, just before the
passage about the churches, “she took to going out; wandering the countryside;
to train travel, to other cities, alone and engrossed. Once, not having
returned for three days, and Felix nearly beside himself with terror, she
walked in late at night and said that she had been halfway to Berlin.”

Where are Robin’s barriers, then? Much as Felix leads her to wandering by
demanding to know where his unborn child is, where are Robin’s rocks?

---

![Robin and Felix](/images/paris-1911/robin-felix.png)

Note: If I add places in Paris Felix either mentions or visits, the topography
of the city starts to fill in a bit, while also gesturing toward’s Felix’s own
peculiarities. His claims to aristocracy and financial security are signaled
by his working at Crédit Lyonnais, and by the doctor’s suggestion that they
get lunch in the Bois de Boulogne, but he also circulates in the sixth
arrondissement with Dr. O’Connor, which is where they both meet Robin when the
doctor is asked to revive her from being passed out one night. And their own
courtship progresses along the spine of the rue Bonaparte, from the Jardin du
Luxembourg up to the Seine.

---

![Robin, Felix, and Nora](/images/paris-1911/robin-felix-nora.png)

Note: When Robin leaves Felix, she goes to New York, where she meets Nora.
Upon their return to Paris, Nora buys an apartment, chosen by Robin, at the
rue du Cherche-Midi. Within two paragraphs, the narrator notes that “the time
came that Nora was alone most of the night and part of the day,” however,
which also accounts for Nora’s small spatial footprint within Paris. Robin’s
the wanderer; Nora merely chases, as the other dot here, referring to an
extended incident in Montparnasse, reveals.

---

![Robin, Felix, Nora, and Jenny](/images/paris-1911/robin-felix-nora-jenny.png)

Note: Jenny, with “the collective income four dead husbands could afford,” has
a much more aristocratic Paris. She lives off the Champs-Elysees, goes to the
opera, and dines both in the Bois de Boulogne and at the Ambassadeurs,
because, as the narrator wryly notes, “Jenny feared meeting Nora.” She is
familiar with Nora and Robin’s apartment, but even so, her expansive region
presses on Nora’s, which is perfectly fitting. The chapter in which she is
introduced, “The Squatter,” includes this observation from the narrator:

---

> When she fell in love it was with a perfect fury of accumulated dishonesty;
she became instantly a dealer in second-hand and therefore incalculable
emotions. As, from the solid archives of usage, she had stolen or appropriated
the dignity of speech, so she appropriated the most passionate love that she
knew, Nora’s for Robin. She was a “squatter” by instinct.

--> Barnes, _Nightwood_, 74–75.

Note: Jenny can only impersonate and fill regions to choke away the originals
she copies. Even the central story related to her in the narrative, of the
carriage trip with Robin, O’Connor, the young girl Sylvia, and the
Englishwoman Robin picks up at one of Jenny’s parties, is copied, told once
from the perspective of the narrator and once from O’Connor’s perspective.

---

![Robin, Felix, Nora, and Jenny](/images/paris-1911/robin-felix-nora-jenny.png)

Note: We can see it here on the map. As Alex Christie and Katie Tanigawa note,
however, the trajectories of both trips are reversed. When the narrator
describes the trip, they leave Jenny’s and head for the Bois. Soon after, they
are “long past the pond and the park and were circling back again, toward the
lower parts of town.” Jenny strikes Robin and then the carriage drops Robin
off at her apartment. In O’Connor’s retelling, however, “we went riding down
the Champs Elysées. We went straight as a die over the Pont Neuf, and whirled
around into the rue du Cherche-Midi, God forgive us!” The Bois is completely
ignored.

---

![All characters](/images/paris-1911/all-dots.png)

Note: When we add in O’Connor, we see that his image spreads widely across the
city in comparison. Not only is he involved in many places with other
characters, but he himself details in digressions about his own experiences
cruising for men near the Bastille, for example, or trying to masturbate in
the St. Merri church. Yet we also see, with all five characters accounted for,
just how off the path Robin’s trip to the Picpus Cemetery is.

---

> On the second landing of the hotel (it was one of those middle-class
hostelries… so typical that it might have been moved every night and not have
been out of place) a door was standing open, exposing a red carpeted floor…

> About [Robin’s]
head there was an effulgence as of phosphorus glowing about the circumference
of a body of water—as if her life lay through her in ungainly luminous
deteriorations—the troubling structure of the born somnambule, who lives in
two worlds—meet of child and desperado… 

--> Barnes, _Nightwood_, 37–38.

Note: Some close reading might better place Robin within the city. When Felix
and O’Connor come across her at her hotel, the narrator presents Robin as a
phantasm. First, her hotel is so indistinct that it could move through the
night unnoticed, much in the way Robin aims to. Robin herself is described as
a “somnambule,” the word that also names this chapter. Robin moves at night,
like a sleep walker, but also flitting between two worlds. Furthermore, the
narrator gestures at a destruction or ephemerality to Robin. Here, her life
has its luminous deteriorations. A few paragraphs later, after trying to get
to her feet and prove she’s all right, the narrator describes how she “fell
back into the pose of her annihilation.”

---

> Something of this emotion came over Felix, but being racially incapable of
abandon, he felt that he was looking upon a figurehead in a museum, which
though static, no longer roosting on its cutwater, seemed yet to be going
against the wind; as if this girl were the converging halves of a broken fate,
setting face, in sleep, toward itself in time, as an image and its reflection
in a lake seem parted only by the hesitation in the hour.

--> Barnes, _Nightwood_, 41.

Note: Felix is overcome by her instability. She is at once a static statue,
like a map, but also shows the effect of the wind on her, a person not quite
split, but out of phase. 

---

> I find that I never did have a really clear idea of her at any time. I
had an image of her, but that is not the same thing. An image is a stop the
mind makes between uncertainties.  

--> Barnes, _Nightwood_, 119.

Note: Later, after Robin has left Felix, he meets O’Connor and tells him he
is in “mental trouble”. The two men dine in the Bois de Boulogne, and Felix
begins to recount Robin to the doctor, again with language of uncertainty,
fluidity. His description of her as an image again relies on the fantasy of
detemporalization similar to that of the map, where an object can be frozen
long enough for deep observation. Even thinking of Robin as a fixed object in
the past, as he sees his own family history, because it was given to him from
only one source, doesn’t work.

---

> And Robin? I know where your mind is! She, the eternal momentary—Robin who
was always the second person singular.

--> Barnes, _Nightwood_, 135.

Note: We’re looking for rocks here, however, and Robin doesn’t seem to have
any, at least not that we can see. She’s in fact an exercise in uncertainty,
the empty center, in the words of Teresa de Lauretis, around which the lives
and passions of the others spin. Lauretis also how Robin, at the novel’s end,
shows an excess of affect. That excess seems to render Robin diffuse, exploded
all over the map to invisibility like atoms in a map. Felix can only see
snapshots of her, images that are useless as soon as they exist. Here,
O’Connor tells Nora that Robin is this eternal momentary, moving out of the
frame with every tick. And yet,

---

> But you, you must unspin fate, go back to find Robin! That's
what you are going to do. 

--> Barnes, _Nightwood_, 133.

Note: capturing Robin’s elusivity is precisely what O’Connor commands Nora to
do. She has to bend time backwards and bring Robin to her. And here is the
spatial twist in the novel, where the fate gets unspun. In aiming to form a
sense of the image of the city with Robin at the center, drawing her paths,
edges, and regions--hunting for her rocks, it may be that Robin’s spectrality
is precisely why her wandering contributes to no image. She’s all image
herself, represented to the reader in other’s narratives, always the you who
is addressed and never the I who expresses.

Note: Recall the clearest edge here, the one between Nora and Jenny. Jenny
dines at Ambassadeurs, because, as the narrator tells us, “Jenny feared
meeting Nora.” And when the carriages take Robin back to the apartment on Rue
du Cherche-Midi, the only location both retellings of the evening include, 

---

> The carriage at this moment drew smartly up into the _rue du Cherche-Midi_.
Robin jumped before the carriage stopped, but Jenny was close behind her,
following her as far as the garden.

> It was not long after this that Nora and Robin separated; a little later Jenny
and Robin sailed for America.

--> Barnes, _Nightwood_, 83. Italics in original.

Note: Jenny is stopped in the garden, disinclined to to go further and
confront Nora as well, reaching her own edge. Only Nora eventually crosses the
edge and goes to meet Jenny, which leads to Robin’s leaving Nora without even
a word, refusing to respond even to Nora’s last words, “Have you nothing to
say to me”?

---

> There is a
gap in “world pain” through which the singular falls continually and forever;
a body falling in observable space, deprived of the privacy of disappearance;
as if privacy, moving relentlessly away, by the very sustaining power of its
withdrawal kept the body eternally moving downward, but in one place, and
perpetually before the eye. Such a singular was Nora. There was some
derangement in her equilibrium that kept her immune from her own descent.

--> Barnes, _Nightwood_, 56.

Note: As Robin appears too unstable, too out of phase, herself too much of a
wandering rock to be affected by any sort of edges, we see Jenny with her own
edges in contrast, and here, the narrator describes Nora in detail for the
first time. Where Robin is an ephemeral flicker, like an old television not
quite catching the right frequency, Nora is its opposite, wholly observable
and visible. And her visibility is always tied in with the underlying trope of
motion in the novel, the downward motion of the bow down and the decline of
the descent. As a body moving through space with weight and distinction, Nora
responds to paths and edges, she has an image of the city, even if she can
barely see herself in it.

---

> “Robin can go anywhere, do anything,” Nora continued, “because she forgets,
and I nowhere, because I remember.”

--> Barnes, _Nightwood_, 161.

> A shadow was falling on her—mine—and it was driving her out of her wits.

--> Barnes, _Nightwood_, 165.

Note: Robin’s impermanence in comparison to Nora’s shows the degree to which
Robin herself, paradoxically, in her ephemerality, hems Robin in. Robin goes
out at night and wanders everywhere. She “meets everyone,” as Nora says, while
Nora stays at home, worried that putting the slightest piece of furniture out
of the way will mean Robin never returns. And at the same time, Nora is an
obstacle for Robin. This begins to resemble that state of what Lauren Berlant
calls cruel optimism, when your object of desire is also an obstacle to your
flourishing.

---

> In the beginning, after Robin went away with Jenny to America, I searched for
her in the ports. Not literally, in another way. Suffering is the decay of the
heart; all that we have loved becomes the ‘forbidden,’ when we have not
understood it all, as the pauper is the rudiment of a city, knowing something
of the city, which the city, for its own destiny, wants to forget. So the
lover must go against nature to find love. I sought Robin in Marseilles, in
Tangier, in Naples, to understand her, to do away with my terror. I said to
myself, I will do what she has done, I will love what she has loved, then I
will find her again. 

--> Barnes, _Nightwood_, 165–166.

Note: Out of her wits herself, Nora becomes the sleuth following the wanderer,
and this is the image with which I’ll close this reading of Nightwood. Nora
collapses the image of her love for Robin with this image of the city, with a
pauper as both the initial image and incompletely formed component of the
city. The city wants to forget the pauper in order to move forward, past its
beginnings. Nora, as one who cannot forget, cannot move forward. Surrounded by
edges, she can only emulate Robin and look inward,

---

> I haunted the cafés where Robin had lived her night-life; I drank with the
men, I danced with the women, but all I knew was that others had slept with my
lover and my child. For Robin is incest too, that is one of her powers… I
thought, ‘I will do something that she will never be able to forgive, then we
can begin again as strangers.’ But the sailor got no further than the hall. He
said: _Mon dieu, il y a deux chevaux de bois dans la chambre à coucher_.

--> Barnes, _Nightwood_, 166.

Note: Becoming Robin means shifting into Robin’s space, into her city. Yet
even so, the image is both familiar--incestuous--and different, underscored by
how when Nora attempts to bring a man to bed, to wipe the slate clean, he
flees in confusion after seeing the wooden horses in the bedroom, standing in
for the toys with which Robin would play while also watching Nora, to make
sure, in Nora’s words, that “no one called, that the bell did not ring, that I
got no mail.” And so on. As Nora sighs after her list of what Robin forbade
her, “my life was hers.” 

---

> [O’Connor’s] fabrications seemed to be the framework of a forgotten but
imposing plan.

--> Barnes, _Nightwood_, 33.

Note: In mapping out Nightwood, in looking for those edges
and rocks, the wanderer becomes Nora, who takes her travels to a European
scale in order to find Robin. After telling O’Connor of her encounter with the
sailor, she reiterates her trips to Marseilles, Tangier, and Naples, ending
with, in her words, that “centre of eroticism and death,” thinking of melting
together with Robin as though they were both made of wax. O’Connor,
wordlessly, gets up and leaves, the ringmaster of the circus of the novel can
fabricate no response, there is no plan anymore.

## _The Crying of Lot 49_
### Thomas Pynchon, 1965

Note: That idea of fabricating a plan takes me to the second text, a return to
the Oedipa of the title and the rocks she encounters trying to execute Pierce
Inverarity’s will. Like Nora sleuths Robin, so, too, does Oedipa spend the
novel sleuthing, even congratulating herself at one point for wearing flats,
a prophylactic against the labor of walking while following her various leads.
Nevertheless, early in the novel, the narrator gives us a different
fabricated, yet imposing plan.

---

> San Narciso lay further south, near L.A. Like many named places in California
it was less an identifiable city than a grouping of concepts—census tracts,
special purpose bond-issue districts, shopping nuclei, all overlaid with
access roads to its own freeway. But it had been Pierce’s domicile, and
headquarters: the place he’d begun his land speculating in ten years ago… and
that, she
supposed, would set the spot apart, give it an aura. But if there was any
vital difference between it and the rest of Southern California, it was
invisible on first glance.

--> Pynchon, _The Crying of Lot 49_, 24.

Note: San Narciso, 

---

> She drove into San Narciso on a Sunday [and squinted] onto a vast sprawl of houses which had grown up all together,
like a well-tended crop, from the dull brown earth; and she thought of the
time she'd opened a transistor radio to replace a battery and seen her first
printed circuit. The ordered swirl of houses and streets, from this high
angle, sprang at her now with the same unexpected, astonishing clarity as the
circuit card had. Though she knew even less about radios than about Southern
Californians, there were to both outward patterns a hieroglyphic sense of
concealed meaning, of an intent to communicate.

--> Pynchon, _The Crying of Lot 49_, 24.
