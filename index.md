Note: I want to start this talk with a story that may be familiar to you all.
Hopefully, it isn’t, but we’ll see. Here we have a map of Königsberg from,
according to Wikipedia, 1613. This city is now known as KalininGRAT, and it’s
part of Russia. I want to turn the clock forward one hundred years, though,

Note: And ask you to imagine yourself here on the Kneiphof, the central
island, studying at the university. You’re about a generation older than
Immanuel Kant. Let’s say it’s one in the morning, and you’ve been drinking
with your classmates. Invariably, so the story goes, the challenge will arise:
can you cross all seven bridges across the Pregel River, and I’ve colored the
Pregel
in here to make the bridges more visible, can you cross all seven bridges once
and only once? Maybe you make a wager with your classmates and stumble out
into the bracing Baltic wind, but you’re convinced that, this time, it’s
surely possible.

![Trying to walk the bridges in Königsberg](/images/pregel-walks.gif)

Note: Because we’re not in Königsberg, and most of the applicable bridges have
been destroyed anyway, we can’t actually get drunk and totter from bridge to
bridge. I’ve sort of made an approximation of what could follow here, but the
key is that the challenge you’re discussing with your classmates can take
several forms.

---

1. Cross the bridge by the Cathedral,
2. then take the Holzbrücke towards the castle,
3. then Schmiedebrücke by the castle back onto Kneiphof,
4. then cross back at Krämerbrücke and… rats ok let’s start again…

Note: You can list the steps out, for example, turning the journey into
something resembling driving directions or what a GPS device would tell you.

![A failed path in Königsberg](/images/konigsberg-1613-pregel-crop-path.jpg)

Note: The directions above can also take the form of a sketched out path on a
map. Yet here, a subtle shift has occurred. What on the previous slide could
be considered as a kind of transversing of space, here, instead, is now a
transversed space. There is no change in this map, as the path is frozen. In
fact, this map can represent two sets of walking directions, the to and fro.
The motion, the process, of the listed steps is instead frozen. This map has
ripped the narrative energy out of your nighttime prowl, turning an event into
a datum, events into data. Two similar examples:

---

> Suddenly she took the Catholic vow. She came into the church silently… Many
churches saw her: _St. Julien le Pauvre_, the church of _St. Germain des Prés_,
_Ste. Clothilde_. Even on the cold tiles of the Russian church, in which there
is no pew, she knelt alone, lost and conspicuous, her broad shoulders above
her neighbours, her feet large and as earthly as the feet of a monk.
She strayed into the _rue Picpus_, into the gardens of the convent of
_L’Adoration Perpétuelle_. 

<div class="credit">Barnes, _Nightwood_, 49–50. Italics in original.</div>

Note: Robin Vote has taken to wandering from her husband, and here we see her
moving through various churches in Paris. Barnes doesn’t give us an itinerary
per se, but compare this description here to its rendering as data.

---

<div class="map" id="robin-vote"></div>

Note: Robin’s straying is frozen and removed from the clustering Barnes
provides narratively “many churches saw her” creates one group and then
“strayed into the rue Picpus” a second, with an indistinct "Russian church in
which there is no pew" between them. Instead, here the clustering is
geographical: rive gauche churches in contrast to the rive droite convent. And
now I'm forced to decide that "Russian church" refers to the Nevsky Cathedral
in Paris, breaking the promise of uncertainty that Barnes provided. Yet we’re
still building here with these nighttime strayings… Königsberg, Paris,

> The carrier led her across Market then over toward City Hall. In a street close enough to the drab, stone openness of the Civic Center to be infected by its gray, he rendezvoused with another carrier, and they exchanged sacks. Oedipa decided to stick with the one she’d been following. She tailed him all the way back down the littered, shifty, loud length of Market and over on First Street to the trans-bay bus
terminal, where he bought a ticket for Oakland. So did Oedipa.

> They rode over the bridge and into the great, empty glare of the Oakland
afternoon. The landscape lost all variety.

![Euler’s map of Königsberg](https://i.imgur.com/HTezdGR.png)

<div class="credit">Euler, “[Solutio Problematis Ad Geometriam Situs
Pertinentis](http://eulerarchive.maa.org/docs/originals/E053.pdf).”</div>

Note: In 1735, Leonhard Euler presents a paper before the St. Petersburg
Academy of Sciences. When published, the article includes an abstracted map of
Königsberg, a step removed from any sort of map one would use to move around
in the city, which I’ve adapted here. Kneiphof becomes just “A,” and each bridge is a lowercase letter.

---

> Si fuerint plures duabus regiones, ad quas ducentium pontium numerus est
impar, tum certo affirmari potest, talem transitum non dari.

> If there are more than two areas to which an odd number of bridges lead,
then such a journey is impossible.

<div class="credit">Euler,
“[Solutio…](http://eulerarchive.maa.org/docs/originals/E053.pdf)” and “[The
Solution of a Problem Relating to the Geometry of
Position](https://books.google.com/books?id=XqYTk0sXmpoC&lpg=PA2&pg=PA8#v=onepage&q&f=false)”
in Biggs, Lloyd, Wilson, _Graph Theory 1736–1936_.</div>

Note: Even for someone not particularly mathematically inclined like me,
Euler’s proof is exceptionally readable, and it leads to the conclusion I’ve
excerpted here. Nevertheless, what I want to underscore is the way the
story moves from our imagined fiction of drunk students stumbling around the
city to Euler’s sterilizing reframing of the question. People are removed from
the question, and places become mere letters.

---

![Königsberg as graph](/images/euler-graph.png)

Note: Current accounts of the problem abstract it even further. At least Euler
still speaks of “regiones” and “pontes,” regions and bridges. Here, the
bridges are now “edges” and the shores of the Pregel bound “nodes.” What began
this talk as a map of Königsberg, already abstracted in its own way, is now,
simply, a graph, the locus of interest for the branch of mathematics, graph
theory, that emerged out of Euler’s paper. Again, the people, the buildings…
none of that matters anymore

It’s tempting to read this as a progression from the particular to the
universal, as surely that was Euler’s goal. But there’s also a reason for
starting both with a map and a story. When arguing with your classmates in
that 18th century Prussian beer hall, you’re not relying on a map to guide
your walk but also on the image of Königsberg you have built up in your mind.
