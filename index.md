Note: I want to start this talk with a story that may be familiar to you all.
Hopefully, it isn’t, but we’ll see. Here we have a map of Königsberg from,
according to Wikipedia, 1613. This city is now known as KalininGRAT, and it’s
part of Russia. I want to turn the clock forward one hundred years, though,

Note: And ask you to imagine yourself here on the Kneiphof, the central
island, studying at the university. You’re about a generation older than
Immanuel Kant. Let’s say it’s one in the morning, and you’ve been drinking
with your classmates. Invariably, so the story goes, the challenge will arise:
can you cross all seven bridges across the Pregel River, and I’ve colored it
in here to make the bridges more visible, can you cross all seven bridges once
and only once? Maybe you make a wager with your classmates and stumble out
into the bracing Baltic wind, but you’re convinced that, this time, it’s
surely possible.

Spoiler: It’s not actually possible.

![Euler’s map of Königsberg](https://i.imgur.com/HTezdGR.png)

Note: In 1735, Leonhard Euler presents a paper before the St. Petersburg
Academy of Sciences. When published, the article includes an abstracted map of
Königsberg, a step removed from any sort of map one would use to move around
in the city, which I’ve adapted here. Kneiphof becomes just “A,” and each bridge is a lowercase letter.
For Euler to demonstrate why the circuit of all seven bridges of Königsberg
is impossible, proper names relating to specific places are no longer
important. The staggering wandering of the students in the early 18th century
is replaces by this map.

![Königsberg as graph](/images/euler-graph.png)

Note: Current accounts of the problem abstract it even further, to change the
bridges into “edges” and the shores of the Pregel into “nodes.” What began
this talk as a map of Königsberg, already abstracted in its own way, is now,
simply, a graph, the locus of interest for the branch of mathematics, graph
theory, that emerged out of Euler’s paper. The people, the buildings… none of
that matters anymore, as Euler aimed to find the general solution to the
problem for any number of bridges and any number of shores or islands.

It’s tempting to read this as a progression from the particular to the
universal, and surely that was Euler’s goal; he begins his paper, after all,
by considering the case of n bridges over a single river.
